## description

i wanted to make an art project that was also kind of a game. it's basically a tamagotchi -- feed it different types of food and wait a few minutes to see what it grows into. there is a different adult stage for each kind of food!

originally intended for this to also be a dragon-based mmo (not science-based, i'm not crazy). but i decided to try polishing a project for once, instead of cramming in async multiplayer. would have been cool though, i wanted to make it have a lifespan of hours instead of minutes, and let anyone playing feed everyone else's pets c:

this is a set of basecode that i made last year to gather together boilerplate and features that i was reimplementing every LD. this was my first trial run actually using it in a project, and it actually went pretty well, aside from losing a few hours to an unexpected bug that turned out to be in the base code, and not sticking to the architecture very well. i think i'll elaborate on it in a blog post
